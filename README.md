# AwesomeWM at its prime!
 
 This is my custom config files for AwesomeWM. 
 Copy them over to ~/.config/awesome/
 
 #### Commands
     git clone --recursive </br> 
     cd AwesomeWM-Config/ </br>
     cp rc.lua theme.lua ~/.config/awesome/ </br>
 
 I made it so the wm has 2 wiboxes, this is considered pretty uncommon but enjoy!

I actually riced this in Ubuntu 2016.04 on 2022, so it should be mostly compatible, but may error out in newer builds on the arch repo
