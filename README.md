# AwesomeWM at its prime!
 
 This is my custom config files for AwesomeWM. 
 Copy them over to ~/.config/awesome/
 
 #### Commands
     git clone --recursive https://github.com/cyberprince04107/Teds-Awesome.git
     cd Teds-Awesome/ 
     cp rc.lua theme.lua ~/.config/awesome/ 
 
 I made it so the wm has 2 wiboxes, this is considered pretty uncommon, but enjoy!
 
 ## Dependencies 
 
 - AwesomeWM (Obviously)
 - Guake
 - Compton (Forks are fine, just make sure to alter the rc.lua accordingly. (Reccommended Fork : https://github.com/tryone144/compton for "Kawase Blur")
 - Nitrogen (or Feh, again, alter the rc.lua for feh!)
 - Gvim
 - Vim
 - Firefox 
 - Vifm
 - cmus
 - st (Please do not use the binary of the simple terminal which is stterm, instead compile it from git://git.suckless.org/st. However, if you really want to use stterm then alter the rc.lua to match it).

## Ctrl+C and V 

##### Debian
    sudo apt-get install guake nitrogen compton git gvim vim firefox vifm cmus

##### Arch-Linux
    sudo pacman -S guake nitrogen compton git gvim vim firefox vifm cmus

## Compatibility

I actually riced this in Ubuntu 2016.04 on 2022, so it should be mostly compatible, but may error out in newer builds on the arch repo.

## Support
